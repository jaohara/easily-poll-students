## Repo Workflow
Use this approach when sitting down to work on the project:

1. Check for any outstanding Pull Requests on Github.
2. Update your local repo.
3. Starting from `main`, create a new feature branch for your changes.
4. Work on your files, adding and commiting them locally as you go.
5. Commit your finalized changes and push your branch to Github.
6. If your feature branch is finished and works as expected, create a Pull Request on Github to merge your feature branch into `main`.
